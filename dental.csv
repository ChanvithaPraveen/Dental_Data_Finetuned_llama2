Dental Panoramic Tomography (Pantomogram)

**Findings:**
The dental panoramic tomography image reveals the following findings:

1. **Palatal Displacement:** Displacement of the maxillary left canine is observed in a palatal direction, resulting in contact with the adjacent lateral incisor.

2. **Malocclusion:** The palatal displacement has led to occlusal interferences and malocclusion.

**Impression:**
The dental panoramic tomography image indicates the presence of palatal displacement of the maxillary left canine causing occlusal interferences.

**Recommendations:**
1. **Orthodontic Evaluation:** Refer the patient to an orthodontist for evaluation and potential treatment to correct the malocclusion.
   
2. **Occlusal Analysis:** Assess occlusal contacts and potential adjustments to restore proper occlusion and function.
